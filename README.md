# DFA-string-acceptor
C++ program to check if given string is accepted by given DFA.

When program runs it asks for symbols:
Symbols for input.txt file is "abt".
Symbols for input1.txt file is "2367".
Symbols for input2.txt file is "pqrs".

In txt files we have a DFA for each case of symbol. After taking symbols it asks for name of the file in which DFA matrix inputs are.
It then asks the string to check if it is accepted by DFA or not.

It is assumed that on 0 there will be no change in state, unless 0 used as symbol otherwise.
